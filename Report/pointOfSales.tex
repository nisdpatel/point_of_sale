% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as,

% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{Ricky Hempel, Nisha Patel, and Josh Cannon\\% <-this % stops a space
}
%Generally you should be the only author, so drop Michael Shell's name when you are creating your lab reports

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

% this:

%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2014 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}

% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society jorunal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)

\section{Introduction}




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
%Your introduction should give an introduction to your project.  What are you trying to accomplish (high level), who do you expect to target with your project?  What do you expect your target audience will get out of it?


	We are creating a point of sale application that can allow  customers to purchase clothes, grocery, electronics, and books from different departments. Our point of sale will have a menu-driven interface where a user can view or select items from a drop-down menu. Every department has their own drop-down menu with the list of items and prices. As the user goes though the different departments, he or she can add the items in the cart. Once they have added all the items in the cart, they can go the check-out interface where they can pay the total amount of the purchase with either cash or a card.  \newline

	We have designed our system for small-emerging private franchises such as specifically targeting retail marketing where their targeted audience will be a general audience such as college students, working employees, and/or retired people. Our point of sale is easily operable by any retail store employee, and  is specifically for small departmental stores.

%Should you need to cite anything, use the \emph{cite} keyword, and refer to something from your bibliography.  For example, this was put together with the help of a \LaTeX guide\cite{IEEEhowto:kopka}.


%Make sure that by the end of your introduction the reader knows what your project is and why you are doing it.



\subsection{Planning}
What does a point of sale need? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Menu-driven interface for all departments and their sub departments with the list of items and prices
\item Add to cart can constantly update the cart as soon as the user adds an item
\item Keep track of added items into the cart
\item A running display of total
\item Tax calculation
\item A keypad
\item Payment options (cash or credit)
\end{itemize}


%Occasionally you need to break your sections into separate parts, you will likely not need a subsection for every section

% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

%\subsubsection{What might get added later: }
 
%Occasionally you will need to break your subsections into separate parts, if you find yourself using this often, you're likely going overboard.  Don't try to go any lower down than this...


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

\subsection{Background}

%In this section, give a brief background to any concepts the reader may need to know to make it through your paper.   Are there any specific terms the reader needs to be familiar with?

%Also, consider going into your personal connection with this project -- why did you decide to do it?

Point of sale systems are used by the vast majority of retail and restaurant chains today. They simplify the lives of both the employees and customers by making checkout time faster. The also help company operations by automating inventory and accounting. Our point of sale systems needs be easy enough for anyone to learn to use. It should be intuitive enough to use with little or no training and allow employees or customer to place an order and check out in efficient manner. We plan to do this an easy to understand GUI. Just click to add items to cart and check out. \\

A point of sale is a user interface to purchase objects. We decided to do this project because it is something that everyone uses all the time without thinking. We wanted to learn more about what actually goes on as a user is checking out a product.   


\subsection{Challenges}
%For your first deliverable, this should be a list of where you believe you will get stuck -- what do you see as the most difficult portion of your project?
The biggest challenge would be the communication between main menu interface and their sub-menus. For instance, one of department called Books is going to be one of the tab in the main menu. Once use clicked on the Book, it will redirect them into the sub menu for the Books where it has list of books with name, author's name, and price. The challenge here would be how are we going to link the main and sub menu together. \\

Once we get the basics done, the next challenge would be to keep updating the shopping cart after a user adds an item. There will be more once we start working on it. For example, what design pattern are we going to use for the software that is easy to implement, straight forward user interface, and use of local database that can track our inventories. While picking a specific design pattern, we have make sure if it serves our purpose or not before we start scripting.

%As you overcome these challenges, this section becomes more of a retrospective: don't only identify the challenge, but also briefly outline the solution!


\section{Scope}
%This section is a bit tricksy.  You are going to do your best to set up ground rules:  How will you know when your project is done?
The final goal of our project is the following: first, it will provide a menu-driven interface of a departmental store. Second, it will allow users to view, select the available products, and add items into the cart. Third, it will allow user to go to the final step where they can check out their cart by paying the total amount in cash or by card. \newline

Currently, we are assuming that we are creating this application to sell it in the small-emerging private retail market. We will be testing this application in our departmental store first, then sell it as a point of sale software for a fixed price. Once the base is done, we can update our system according to the company's requirements.Our two ``stretch goals" would be first adding more products that are easily customizable as needed and provide an accurate final result. Moreover, it should allow the user to add any number of items in the cart and check out by paying the right total amount.\\
\subsection{Estimate Time}
We would say that our project will be done roughly within a month and a half. If we finish it early, we can add other features.
%If you were doing this under contract for a company, this would be your checklist to make sure you get paid.  We will be going into this in more detail over time, but you should start planning your major goals of the project as soon as possible.


%For every sub(sub)section below, make sure to mark which items are basic goals (project won't be done without it) and which ones are stretch goals (it would be really cool to do...).  We will be meeting one-on-one to help identify which goals go where.



\subsection{Requirements}
%As part of fleshing out the scope of your requirements, you'll also need to keep in mind both your functional and non-functional requirements.  These should be listed, and explained in detail as necessary.  Use this area to explain how you gathered these requirements.
The requirements we gathered for our point of sales system are the following: 



\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item User needs to have a private shopping cart -- this cannot be shared between users, and needs to maintain state across subsequent visits to the site
\item User can add more than one items -- cart should automatically update the total number of items as soon as user adds a new item.
\item Users need to have website accounts or store accounts -- this will help track recent purchases, keep shopping cart records, etc. 
\item User can pay with cash or cards -- card has to be valid.
\item User pays verified total amount -- this will verifies and calculate accurate total checkout amount.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Security -- user credentials must be encrypted on disk, users should be able to reset their passwords if forgotten or update their personal information for the local store accounts.
\item Accuracy -- system must calculate the correct total amount from the user without any errors. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}
It collects all required information from the user about the software he/she want. It asked specific detailed questions about there need and outcome. It gives a rough idea to an user of what and how our point pf sale is interating.
%This subsection is arguably part of how you define your project scope (why it is in the Scope section...).  In a traditional Waterfall approach, as part of your requirements gathering phase (what does the product actually \emph{need} to do?), you will typically sit down with a user to develop use cases.

%You should have a table listing all use cases discussed in the document, the ID is just the order it is listed in, the name should be indicative of what should happen, the primary actor is typically most important in an application where you may have different levels of users (think admin vs normal user), complexity is a best-guess on your part as to how hard it should be.  A lower number in priority indicates that it needs to happen sooner rather than later.  A sample table, or Use Case Index can be seen in Table \ref{tab:useCaseIndex}.
\begin{table}[!htb]
\centering
\scalebox{0.9}{
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Use Case ID & Use Case Name & Primary Actor & Complexity & Priority \\
\hline \hline
1 &Click on different menus to see all products that are being offered in the store & Shopper & Med & 1\\
\hline
2 & Add item to cart & Shopper & Med & 1\\
\hline
3 & Checkout & Shopper and Cashier (applicable to both) & Med & 2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}\\
\caption{Point of Sale Use Case Table}
\label{tab:useCaseIndex}
\end{table}



\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 1
\item[Use Case Name:] Click on different menus to see all products that are being offered in the store
\item[Description:] A shopper on our site can explore the different departments and there products. They can click on ``Department Name i.e., Books" button to view what types of books we are offering with the book name, author name, and price (options varies as per the department). 
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 2
\item[Use Case Name:] Add item to cart. 
\item[Description]: A shopper on our site has identified an item they wish to buy.  They will click on a ``Add to Cart" button.  This will kick off a process to add one instance of the item to their cart. They can add more than one item in cart. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[Use Case Number:] 3
\item[Use Case Name:] Checkout
\item[Description]: A shopper on our site has added item in cart and now they are ready to checkout. They will click on ``Checkout" button. This will kick off a process to calculate the total amount with price and taxes. 
\end{itemize} 
Note: Add an additional use case(s) if needed.
The flow of the point of sale would be like the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User navigates to department listing.
\item User navigates to page listing desired item in a particular department.
\item User left-clicks on ``Add to Cart" button.
\item User cart is updated to reflect the new item, this also updates the current total.
\item User left-clicks on ``Checkout" button to pay the total amount.
\item(Termination Outcome) The user now has a single instance of the item in their cart.
\end{enumerate} 
\textbf{User Stories}:\\
User Story 1: As a user, he or she will be able to click on different department to see what products are being offered\\
User Story 2: Once the user has explore the menu, now he or she can add items in to the cart by clicking ``add to cart" button. Furthermore, the user can see the current running total of the cart on the display. \\
User Story 3: When the user is ready to checkout, he or she can click``checkout" button on the screen and that will allow them to pay the final price including the taxes.

%You may need to also add in any alternative flows:

%Alternative: Item already exists in the cart
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item User navigates to page listing desired item
%\item User left-clicks on ``Add to Cart" button.
%\item User cart is updated to reflect the new item, showing that one more instance of the existing item has been added.  This also updates the current total.
%\item[Termination Outcome] The user now has multiple instances of the item in their cart.
%\end{enumerate}

%You will often also need to include pictures or diagrams.  It is quite common to see use-case diagrams in such write-ups.  To properly reference an image, you will need to use the \texttt{figure} environment and will need to reference it in your text (via the \texttt{ref} command) (see Figure \ref{cat1}).  NOTE: this is not a use case diagram, but a kitten.




\subsection{Interface Mockups}
Point of Sales main menu consists of four options: Grocery, Books, Electronics, and Clothes. Once user clicks on any of the menu, it will redirect them into sub menu of that selected department. It continues navigating the sub sub menu until user finds the item to add in to the cart. For example, user has clicked on Books $->$ Name or Author Name $->$ Clicked Name $->$ List of Books $->$ Clicked on a book $->$ Author's Name and Price, and an option to Add in the cart. \\
Below is a sample diagram that represents point of sales functionality. 
%At first, this will largely be completely made up, as you get further along in your project, and closer to a final product, this will typically become simple screenshots of your running application.

%In this subsection, you will be showing what the screen should look like as the user moves through various use cases (make sure to tie the interface mockups back to the specific use cases they illustrate).

\section{Project Timeline}
%Go back to your notes and look up a typical project development life cycle for the Waterfall approach.  How will you follow this life cycle over the remainder of this semester?  This will usually involve a chart showing your proposed timeline, with specific milestones plotted out.  Make sure you have deliverable dates from the course schedule listed, with a plan to meet them (NOTE: these are generally optimistic deadlines).
 Below is the timeline planned out about how we are following project development life cycle for the Waterfall approach.

\section{Project Structure}
%At first, this will be a little empty (it will need to be filled in by the time you turn in your final report).  This is your chance to discuss all of your design decisions (consider this the README's big brother).
We are planning on using a built-in observer pattern that can maintain a list of object's dependents. We decided to use this pattern because observer pattern will notifies its dependent objects whenever a subject is modified. For instance, if a user clicks add to cart, it will add that item into the cart and likewise if the user removes an item from the cart, it will update the cart by changing the object's state. We are planning to use Abstract Factory Pattern to create different themes for different stores. However, now we have decided to use builder design pattern. 


\subsection{UML Outline}
%Show the full structure of your program.  Make sure to keep on updating this section as your project evolves (you often start out with one plan, but end up modifying things as you move along).  As a note, while Dia fails miserably at generating pdfs (probably my fault), I have had much success with png files.  Make sure to wrap your images in a \texttt{figure} environment, and to reference with the \texttt{ref} command.  For example, see Figure \ref{cat2}.
We have modified the previous interface with this one because navigating from one window to the another until you reach the final sub menu was a bit challenging. We decided to go with a simple option where our design looks simple and easy to implement.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[height=350px, width=350px]{main}

\caption{is a representation of submenu}
\label{submenu}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
%Make sure to actually use at least 2 design patterns from this class.  This is not normally part of such documentation, but largely just specific to this class -- I want to see you use the patterns!
We used built-in observable pattern that can maintain a list of object's dependents and we decided to use this pattern because observer pattern will notifies its dependent objects whenever a subject is modified.  Furthermore, we are using Builder design patter because it separate the construction of a complex objects from its representation so the same construction process can create different representations. In our POS, we are using this method to separate "manager" and "employee" view. For example, on the manager window's, they should be able to view the inventory list where they can add/remove items into the database on the fly. However, on the employee window, they can only have limited access. For instance, employee cannot view the inventory list and they do not have access to add/remove items into the database. We used Microsoft SQL database to store out products according to there category. We also used entity framework that offers an automated mechanism to developers for storing and accessing data in the database. 


\section{Results}
%This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added. 
Our point of sales can do the following tasks: First, user can view the menu-driven interface for all departments with the list of items, prices, and products description. Second, a user can select a department and view the offered items. Third, a user can select item(s) and add into the cart by clicking "Add to Cart" button. Fourth, it can keep track of added or removed items from the cart (constantly updating the cart whenever a user makes any changes). Fifth, when a user click on "checkout" button, it will help them the current running total with the taxes. \\

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[height=250px, width=420px]{checkout.png}
\caption{is a representation of checkout process}
\label{checkout}
\end{figure}



We have met our two stretch goals: a user can add more products that are easily customizable as needed and provide an accurate final total. It also allows a user to add any number of items with repetition in the cart and check out by paying the right total amount. \\



In addition, we have implemented all the use cases in out software. First, a user can select different departments and view what products are being offered. Second, user can add or remove items anytime in the cart. Third, a user can see the final price including the taxes when they click on checkout. In short, our project has all the functionality as we planned. 




\subsection{Future Work}
%Where are you going next with your project?
%For early deliverables, what are your next steps?  (HINT: you will typically want to look back at your timeline and evaluate: did you meet your expected goals?  Are you ahead of schedule?  Did you decide to shift gears and implement a new feature?)
%By the end, what do you plan on doing with this project?  Will you try to sell it?  Set it on fire?  Link to it on your resume and forget it exists?
For the future development, we have to work on the security issues by create a login page for the user and it will grant access according to the entered credentials. For instance, admin has full access to the system whereas employees has limited access. Next, we want to create a prettier interface by adding additional functionality such as add images of the products, so user know what they are buying. Then, create a finite list of inventory with the item counts, so the manager can see how many items has been sold and restock them as needed.  We almost met the expected goals. We decided to shift gears with the initial design because changing a window every time when a user clicks was bit challenging, so we decided to go with a simpler approach by using a listbox. We will be selling this software directly to the retailer once it has all the functionality and we will be linking on your resume.
